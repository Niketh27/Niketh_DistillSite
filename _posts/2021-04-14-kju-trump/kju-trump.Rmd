Ever sit there relaxing after work and wondered "Do I look more like Kim Jong Un or Donald Trump?". Now you can find the definitive answer.


[Click here and upload a picture of your face to find out.](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Niketh27/KJU-Trump-Model/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2FKJU-Trump.ipynb) This might take about a minute to setup the model but I am in the process of deploying the application at a permanent home.

This model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and was developed with the help of the fastaiv2 package.
